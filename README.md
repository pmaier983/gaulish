- [ ] Setup Stripe
- [ ] Setup websockets (https://create.t3.gg/en/other-recs#pusher)

    - Pure React infinite Canvas -> https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-create-a-figma-like-infinite-canvas-in-react-a2b0365b2a7
  - [ ] Components an infinite canvas solution needs to have:
    - P0 drag to move

    - P1 drag and drop to path functionality
    - P2 pinch to zoom
    - P2 a nice interaction at the edges

### Low Priority
